# üö§ Portland Pudgy Development Timeline  

## 1. Where it began
- **What to include:**
  - This all began when I went to Mike the owner of Portland Pudgy looking for an engineering internship. Instead I struck the opportunity with Mike to work on an R&D project to build out an RC electric motor kit for the boats they sell. 
  - The opportunity here is that Currently there is no good remote control solution for turning your boat from gas powered to electric powered. This would be a unique selling point as no one has really done it yet. Also Portland Pudgy having their own unique custom electric boat motor kit would be a unique selling point compared to other electric boat motor kits like Torqueedo and ePropulsion make.
  - This mattered to me to create as it was an exciting and meaningful project as it steered towards reducing carbon emissions from boats, but also stimulated my engineering mind to solve a project using my electrical engineering know how that I was just starting to build while in schoool. This was a task that was certainly out of my comfortzone, but a welcome challenge to really build up my engineering skillset.

### üìç Phase 1: Concept & Research  
- **Situation:**
    - The early stages where I have no real idea what the project will need for components besides batteries to power the boat, rf connection communicate between the RC controller and motors, motors to power the boat, and a microcontroller to program it. I was very much on the edge of my comfort zone where I had an idea of how to go about it, but trusted in my intuition and judgement to make it happen.
- **Task:**
    - First thing to do at this point is start researching previous engineering projects and parts for this project to get familiar.
- **Action:**
    - I tackled the hardest problem first being the RF communcation from the remote control to the motors, solving this first would be critical as without it we can't create an RC boat.
- **Result:** [Outcome, lesson, or milestone achieved]  
## 2. Task  
  - When it comes to starting projects I like to start them like how I like to start my day by doing the hardest part first. Which in this case was figuring out the remote control part.
  - To get myself familiar I got my hands on a pair of NRF24L01 Modules to figure out how to get them to communicate over radio frequencies.
![IMG_3540](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a51ecfae-a98a-4295-b162-865e6e3f34cb)
  - Eventually through a lot of trial and error I was able to create this C++ code for one side of the code to receive the data from the other one and interpret that data with an arduino
  - This code below is a part of the final code for the project so there is more than just the connection setup 
```cpp

#include "printf.h"

#include <Wire.h>

#define CSN_PIN 10

// instantiate an object for the nRF24L01 transceiver
RF24 radio(CE_PIN, CSN_PIN);
// Let these addresses be used for the pair
uint8_t address[][6] = { "pm117", "pc117"};
// It is very helpful to think of an address as a path instead of as an identifying device destination
// to use different addresses on a pair of radios, we need a variable to uniquely identify which address this radio will use to transmit
uint8_t radioNumber = 1; 
String bind = address[radioNumber]; // setting up our bind address
// Used to control whether this node is sending or receiving
bool role = true;  // true = TX role, false = RX role

  Serial.begin(115200);

    // some boards need to wait to ensure access to serial over USB
  }

  Wire.begin();

  // initialize the transceiver on the SPI bus
  if (!radio.begin()) {
    Serial.println(F("radio hardware is not responding!!"));
    while (1) {}  // hold in infinite loop to signify it's not connecting
  }

  // Set the PA Level low to try preventing power supply related problems because these examples are likely run with nodes in close proximity to each other.
  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_LOW);  // RF24_PA_MAX is default.

  // save on transmission time by setting the radio to only transmit the number of bytes we need to transmit a float
  radio.setPayloadSize(sizeof(payload));  // float datatype occupies 4 bytes

  // set the TX address of the RX node into the TX pipe
  radio.openWritingPipe(address[radioNumber]);  // always uses pipe 0

  // set the RX address of the TX node into a RX pipe
  radio.openReadingPipe(1, address[0]);  // using pipe 1
  // in the future adjust the above for another ReadingPipe from the RC
  
  // additional setup specific to the node's role
  if (role) {
    radio.stopListening();  // put radio in TX mode
  } else {
    radio.startListening();  // put radio in RX mode
  }

  // For debugging info
  // printf_begin();             // needed only once for printing details
  // radio.printDetails();       // (smaller) function that prints raw register values
  // radio.printPrettyDetails(); // (larger) function that prints human readable data
