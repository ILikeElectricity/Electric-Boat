## 1. Situation  
- **What to include:**
  - 
  - The origin story of the project ‚Äî why it began.  
  - The problem or challenge (e.g., waterproofing electronics in a marine environment).  
  - Why the project mattered personally and professionally.  
  - Context employers can relate to (‚Äúa small dinghy with a big engineering challenge‚Äù).  

---

## 2. Task  
- **What to include:**  
  - Your objectives and goals.  
  - Constraints you had to balance (budget, environment, safety).  
  - How you defined success (e.g., working prototype, safe charging system).  

---

## 3. Action (Timeline of Development)  

### üìç Phase 1: Concept & Research  
- **Situation:** Describe the initial ideas and inspirations.  
- **Task:** What you set out to figure out at this stage.  
- **Action:** How you researched, gathered requirements, and explored design options.  
- **Result:** Early insights that shaped your approach.  

---

### üìç Phase 2: Early Prototyping  
- **Situation:** First steps moving from idea ‚Üí hardware.  
- **Task:** Building small-scale prototypes to test feasibility.  
- **Action:** Breadboarding, wiring, experimenting with motor control, trial-and-error.  
- **Result:** Wins (and funny failures) that taught you what works in practice.  

---

### üìç Phase 3: System Integration  
- **Situation:** Needing to connect subsystems (ESCs, batteries, thrusters, wireless).  
- **Task:** Get everything talking together reliably.  
- **Action:** Debugging, soldering, testing communication (e.g., NRF24L01, ESP32).  
- **Result:** A partially functional system ‚Äî first time everything ‚Äúcame alive.‚Äù  

---

### üìç Phase 4: PCB Design & Refinement  
- **Situation:** Prototype too messy / fragile for real use.  
- **Task:** Create a robust PCB to house the system.  
- **Action:** Designing in KiCad, selecting components, handling first board spin issues.  
- **Result:** A professional-looking board (with a few lessons learned from mistakes).  

---

### üìç Phase 5: Waterproofing & Field Testing  
- **Situation:** Electronics must survive saltwater & rough handling.  
- **Task:** Make the system marine-proof.  
- **Action:** Testing waterproof enclosures, connectors, lanyards, wireless charging case.  
- **Result:** Successful water tests (or dramatic failures that led to better designs).  

---

### üìç Phase 6: Iteration & Scaling  
- **Situation:** Adding advanced features (e.g., regenerative charging).  
- **Task:** Improve performance and add capabilities.  
- **Action:** Redesigning circuits, implementing smarter firmware, revisiting system constraints.  
- **Result:** Stronger, more capable system closer to real-world applications.  

---

## 4. Result  
- **What to include:**  
  - Tangible outcomes (working RC dinghy system, battery management success).  
  - Quantifiable performance metrics if available (runtime, charge efficiency, range).  
  - Skills gained: circuit design, embedded programming, waterproofing, testing.  
  - The project‚Äôs potential impact in sustainability/marine robotics.  

---

## 5. Reflection & Next Steps  
- **What to include:**  
  - Lessons learned about engineering, iteration, and persistence.  
  - Personal growth (problem-solving, project management, creativity).  
  - How this project connects to your career ambitions (BMS, marine robotics, renewable energy).  
  - Future development plans (improving, scaling, commercialization).
