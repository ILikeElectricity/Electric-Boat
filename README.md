# üö§ Portland Pudgy Development Timeline  

## 1. Situation  
- **What to include:**
  - This all began when I went to Mike the owner of Portland Pudgy looking for an engineering internship. Instead I struck the opportunity with Mike to work on an R&D project to build out an RC electric motor kit for the boats they sell. 
  - The opportunity here is that Currently there is no good remote control solution for turning your boat from gas powered to electric powered. This would be a unique selling point as no one has really done it yet. Also Portland Pudgy having their own unique custom electric boat motor kit would be a unique selling point compared to other electric boat motor kits like Torqueedo and ePropulsion make.
  - This mattered to me to create as it was an exciting and meaningful project as it steered towards reducing carbon emissions from boats, but also stimulated my engineering mind to solve a project using my electrical engineering know how that I was just starting to build while in schoool. This was a task that was certainly out of my comfortzone, but a welcome challenge to really build up my engineering skillset.

## 2. Task  
- **What to include:**  
  - The first task I was given was to well make the product!
  - First I started getting familiar with RF through the NRF24L01 module seen below.

## 3. Action (Timeline of Development)  

### üìç Phase 1: Concept & Research  
- **Situation:** Describe the initial ideas and inspirations.  
- **Task:** What you set out to figure out at this stage.  
- **Action:** How you researched, gathered requirements, and explored design options.  
- **Result:** Early insights that shaped your approach.  

---

### üìç Phase 2: Early Prototyping  
- **Situation:** First steps moving from idea ‚Üí hardware.  
- **Task:** Building small-scale prototypes to test feasibility.  
- **Action:** Breadboarding, wiring, experimenting with motor control, trial-and-error.  
- **Result:** Wins (and funny failures) that taught you what works in practice.  

---

### üìç Phase 3: System Integration  
- **Situation:** Needing to connect subsystems (ESCs, batteries, thrusters, wireless).  
- **Task:** Get everything talking together reliably.  
- **Action:** Debugging, soldering, testing communication (e.g., NRF24L01, ESP32).  
- **Result:** A partially functional system ‚Äî first time everything ‚Äúcame alive.‚Äù  

---

### üìç Phase 4: PCB Design & Refinement  
- **Situation:** Prototype too messy / fragile for real use.  
- **Task:** Create a robust PCB to house the system.  
- **Action:** Designing in KiCad, selecting components, handling first board spin issues.  
- **Result:** A professional-looking board (with a few lessons learned from mistakes).  

---

### üìç Phase 5: Waterproofing & Field Testing  
- **Situation:** Electronics must survive saltwater & rough handling.  
- **Task:** Make the system marine-proof.  
- **Action:** Testing waterproof enclosures, connectors, lanyards, wireless charging case.  
- **Result:** Successful water tests (or dramatic failures that led to better designs).  

---

### üìç Phase 6: Iteration & Scaling  
- **Situation:** Adding advanced features (e.g., regenerative charging).  
- **Task:** Improve performance and add capabilities.  
- **Action:** Redesigning circuits, implementing smarter firmware, revisiting system constraints.  
- **Result:** Stronger, more capable system closer to real-world applications.  

---

## 4. Result  
- **What to include:**  
  - Tangible outcomes (working RC dinghy system, battery management success).  
  - Quantifiable performance metrics if available (runtime, charge efficiency, range).  
  - Skills gained: circuit design, embedded programming, waterproofing, testing.  
  - The project‚Äôs potential impact in sustainability/marine robotics.  

---

## 5. Reflection & Next Steps  
- **What to include:**  
  - Lessons learned about engineering, iteration, and persistence.  
  - Personal growth (problem-solving, project management, creativity).  
  - How this project connects to your career ambitions (BMS, marine robotics, renewable energy).  
  - Future development plans (improving, scaling, commercialization).
